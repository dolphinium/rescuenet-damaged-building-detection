# RescueNet: Damaged Building Detection
> High Resolution UAV Semantic Segmentation for Natural Disaster Damage Assessment

## üìã Project Overview
This project implements semantic segmentation for detecting damaged buildings in UAV imagery using the RescueNet dataset. The model helps in rapid damage assessment during natural disasters using drone footage.
